# DateActivity

 * Write an application to tell the user about a day in the past 
 * (their birthday, the Battle of Normandy, the date of their first drink etc.). 
 * It should keep asking until the user enters an empty date. 
 * You can randomly generate the text about the weather and temperature that day, 
 * but you should know enough by now to accurately identify the day of the week 
 * and the number of days between that day and the current date.
 
 * Bonus (Die with the Lie) Have the application give consistent information about the weather and temperature. 
 * If the application is asked about a date that it has already been asked about that run, 
 * it should give the same answer.
